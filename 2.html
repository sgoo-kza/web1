The meta of the game is divided between two different phases: preparation and management (the latter of which is the "meat" of the game). The preparation determines the management phase: in it the player can hire new employees, boost existing employees' stats, assign them to different departments, and equip them with weapons and armor. The management phase consists of sending these employees to extract energy from abnormalities. The success of this process can vary wildly depending on the circumstances of the work, as each abnormality has its unique set of traits that determine how it will behave and what dangers it poses. What makes things challenging is that information about these traits isn't available from the get-go, and the player must discover them through trial and error by earning information points, which are gained through the aforementioned work process, and can be used to learn specific traits of the abnormality, such as work preferences, breach behavior and (only if the player has collected enough information) weapons and armor. Once enough energy is collected, the player can end the day and have their performance rated from A (the best) to F (the worst). This rating is influenced by how many employees survived the day, and is directly proportional to the reward the player will receive, which are "LOB" points, which the player can use to promote existing employees or hire new ones. A penalty is applied to the amount of "LOB" points received at the end of the day based on the danger levels of the abnormalities that escape during the day. Should the player decide to continue, they will (usually) be forced to choose one new abnormality out of a selection of three. The only information given about the selectable abnormalities is their classification numbers and a small text meant to describe them in an intriguing yet mystifying way. Once an abnormality is chosen, it is added with the rest and the preparation phase begins again.
